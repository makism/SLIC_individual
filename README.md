# SLIC_individual
Scripts for the paper: Parcellating whole brain for individuals by simple 
linear iterative clustering. 

Run m1_main.m to play the demo. Here are some notes for exceptions:
1, You might download the NIFTI toolbox and Craddock's demo data manually.
2, For parallel computing, carefully choose the number of parallel workers
   to make the most of the hardware resources and to avoid problems such 
   as the out of memory problem. 
3, It requires quite a lot of memory even with only 3 parallel workers, so
   it is suggested to run on a server rather than a personal computer.
